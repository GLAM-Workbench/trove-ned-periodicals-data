It creates two datasets, one containing details of the periodical titles, and the other listing all the available issues.\n\nThere are two main harvesting steps. The first is to search for periodicals using the API's /result endpoint using the following parameters:\n\n* `q` set to `\"nla.obj\" nuc:\"ANL:NED\"`\n* `format` facet to `Periodical`\n* and `l-availability` set to `y`\n\nThe work records returned by this search are unpacked, and individual versions saved to make sure we get everything. Once this is complete, any duplicate records are merged.\n\nThe second step harvests details of issues by extracting a list of issues for each title from the collection viewer. It then supplements the issue metadata by extracting information for each issue from the journal viewer.",
